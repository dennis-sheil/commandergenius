+_Description: Shared scorefile
+ This version of Circuslinux! uses a shared score file. From now on
  highscores will no longer be saved in ~/.circuslinux but in
  /var/games/circuslinux/scorefile. For configuration options the new file
  ~/.circuslinuxrc will be used.
  .
  To merge all players' old highscores into one file, you can run:
- .
- bash /usr/share/doc/circuslinux/merge_scorefiles.sh
- .
+  bash /usr/share/doc/circuslinux/merge_scorefiles.sh
  as root.
  .
- Each player can then, _after_ playing this version of Circuslinux! at least
- once, delete his ~/.circuslinux file, since his configuration options will
- be saved in  ~/.circuslinuxrc.
- If the player decides not to delete ~/.circuslinux, he can still use a
- version of circuslinux which was compiled without shared scorefile support
- without loosing his old score- and config file.
- Circuslinux! with shared scorefile support will only read the old config
- file to get the players options if ~/.circuslinuxrc does not exist, but
- never write to this file.
