ri-li (2.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Fix typos in the long description (Closes: #444827).
  * Fix FTBFS with gcc 4.3 by getting rid of pre-ISO C++ headers,
    replacing “#include <iostream.h>” with “#include <iostream>”
    followed by “using namespace std;” (Closes: #461705). Add the
    40_fix_gcc4.3_ftbfs patch to this effect.

  * New upstream release
  * Remove deprecated encoding tag from desktop file and full path in exec

  * 20_remove_gentoo_dir.diff - Remove gentoo subdir from Makefile.*
  * Bug #383007 mentions using a merged tarball to get the data package
    + source but I am not sure how to effectively do that.

  [ Gonéri Le Bouder ]
  * add 50_remove_-lpthread.diff so the linker is not called with the useless
    -lpthread, the patch contains the regenerated autofoo files but the
    original change is just a # on front of AC_CHECK_LIB([pthread],
    [pthread_create]) in configure.in
  * remove the Homepage entries in the descriptions
  * refresh debian/copyright, now the game is released under the GLPv3
  * bump the Standards-version to 3.7.3 with no change

ri-li (2.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=high

  [ Eddy Petrișor ]
  * install the .desktop file (Closes: #388462)

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Changed `$(PWD)' to `$(CURDIR)' in debian/rules, which fixes the FTBFS on
    buildds using `sudo' and not `fakeroot', since the $(PWD) is changed when
    sudo is invoked, due to the user change (Closes: #400547).
  * Urgency set to `high' due to RC-buggyness.
  * Added myself in the Uploaders field.
