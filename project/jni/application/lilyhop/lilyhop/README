Hex-a-hop

Hex-a-hop is a great puzzle game in which a girl has to break all the green
tiles in an hexagonal map and step onto a safe tile without getting trapped.
As you progress through the game, more types of tiles are introduced which
make things more difficult and interesting as you progress through the many
levels. You can use the infinite undo feature to retrace your steps if you
make a mistake. You can take as long as you like to complete each level.
