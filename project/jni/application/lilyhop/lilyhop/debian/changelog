  * Fixed a few errors in the code found with valgrind.
  * Reduced the CPU load a little bit. Thanks to Joey Hess
    <joeyh@debian.org> for the patch. Closes: #440377
    There is more to do to get it properly fixed.
  * Code is now big endian clean. Closes: #438857
  * Use an ordinary (ASCII) dash instead of a UTF-8
    encoded one in the Vietnamese translation which is
    invalid in the generated man page.
  * Moved Vietnamese and Bulgarian man page into
    {bg,vi}.UTF-8/ which will be supported in man-db
    version 2.5.0 in the near future. See: #440420
  * Added Tamil translation. Thanks to Tirumurti
    Vasudevan <agnihot3@gmail.com>. Closes: #441040

    Thanks to Piotr Engelking <inkerman42@gmail.com>.

    is now always wrapped if necessary.
  * Most dialog sizes are now properly respected.
  * Avoid segmentation fault on 64 bit systems on start by
    using a workaround for #439071. Closes: #438800

    strings. Especially 40 bytes for optionSlotName are too
    short for Russian and Bulgarian (in UTF-8 encoding).
    This should be responsible for the bogus menu entries
    in the screenshot to #438800.
