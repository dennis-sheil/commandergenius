Description: puzzle game based on hexagonal tiles
 Hex-a-hop is a great puzzle game in which a girl has to break all the green
 tiles in an hexagonal map without getting trapped. There is no time limit and
 no real-time element.
 .
 The objective is simply to destroy all the green hexagonal tiles on each of
 the 100 levels. As you progress through the game, more types of tiles are
 introduced which make things more difficult and interesting.
